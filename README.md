# SSHoney - A SSH Honeypot üçØ written in C

A C based honeypot that captures SSH connections and alerts the host that someone tried to access the server, and what commands they tried to run. 

## Requirements

To run this program, make sure you have the following libraries installed:   

- stdio.h
- stdlib.h
- string.h
- assert.h
- unistd.h
- sys/types.h
- sys/socket.h
- netinet/in.h
- time.h    

These libraries are commonly included in most C compilers and development environments.

## Usage üêùüêùüêù

To compile the program, run: `gcc SSHoney.c -ansi -Wall -o SSHoney`    

To change the port: type `./SSHoney -p PORT` and replace `PORT` with the port you want to run the program on. By default, the program will run on port 22.   

To change the log's name: type `./SSHoney -o NAME` and replace `NAME` with the name of the log file. By default the log will be called log.txt. SSHoneypot will never overwrite log data and will append data to the log. 

Run `./SSHoney -h` for help information.
